		<h3>Depression Memes vs. Positivity Culture:<br>
				Building Constructive Online Communities</h3>
				<br>
		<h4>By Nick Jensen </h4>

		<h5>September 6th, 2018</h5>
		<p>A little while ago one of my friends shared the post below on Facebook, and it stuck into my brain like a splinter for the next week until I was able to rant about it to my dad in the car where he couldn’t escape. Here’s my problem with it: the tweet by @Ayishat_Akanbi and the caption by “This is the worst thing I’ve seen in at least 6 or 7 minutes” are so drastically different from one another both in tone and content. I totally agree with the original tweet. On the other hand, I vehemently detest the caption.</p>

		<p>
			Let’s start with what “positivity culture” is and where it came from. I’ve seen it spring up in response to the vast wave of terribly negative memes and jokes that have inundated the millennial (I include anyone under the age of 35 or so) internet in recent years. See the subreddits <a href="http://reddit.com/r/meirl"> meirl</a> and <a href="http://reddit.com/2meirl4meirl"> 2meirl4meirl</a> for prime examples. These memes and jokes are expressions of a literally sick society. Mental illness has so pervaded millennial online culture that it has become something of a norm. Jokes are rooted in common experiences, so it makes total sense that the destigmatization of mental illness led to people expressing their mental illness partially through jokes.
		</p>
		<p>
		However! Part of what makes depression (the most common mental illness I’ve seen expressed online, followed by anxiety) so debilitating is that people who struggle with it lose their motivation to carry out life. Instead they spend hours listlessly scrolling through the internet. And companies only make it easier for users to consume without end because it makes the company more money through ad revenue. We internalize and come to reflect the media we consume. If the memes you’re seeing tell a story about being powerless to improve your situation, are you filled with inspiration and joie de vivre? No. You come to see depression as unchangeable, something about yourself and your life over which you have absolutely no control. That being said, the pages on which people share these memes do provide the community that people with depression lacked for so long. The pages provide tangible evidence that the users aren’t alone.
	</p>
		<p>
			So this is part of the internet culture that we found ourselves a couple years ago, and which still dominates in many circles. Getting better is hard work. Actively dismissing the shadow on your shoulder and making the small steps that may or may not turn into bigger steps is hard work. Especially when there’s parts of you working against yourself. Especially when there’s a community of people posting memes about your shared struggle, at least in part looking for the validation that comes from getting a thousand upvotes, thumbs-up, or notes. Especially when those sites are incentivized to keep you using them. It requires breaking out of your habits, something that isn’t easy for any of us.
		</p>
		<p>
		On the other hand, neurotypical people have given and continue to give unhelpful advice on how to live with mental illness, not understanding the constant struggle that comes with a sick brain. This led to the “we can’t all be neurotypical, Karen” meme, used to make fun of ignorant neurotypical people. However, I’ve seen the meme used to invalidate therapists’ advice! I’ve even seen it used in response to positivity posts made <i> by people who are mentally ill themselves</i>! While people with mental illnesses are far from a monollith, and therapists aren't always right, it's worth at least considering others' suggestions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Now we can return to the differences between the tweet and caption
		at the top. Positivity culture isn’t, or at least should not be, about wallpapering your negative feelings and letting them fester within the walls of your brain. It’s about breaking away from a cycle of hopelessness. The original tweet is firmly opposing those who ignore the fact that as humans, we won’t always be happy. The caption, however, completely ignores where positivity culture comes from, dismissing it out of hand. “We can’t all be neurotypical, Karen.”
</p>
<p>
	I want the internet and its users to be more mentally healthy. No one is too set in their ways to never change. Positivity culture to me isn’t about always being happy. It’s about approaching life with positivity. Your depressive feelings are valid, but you can influence your surroundings and your habits to feel a bit better in the future. And in the future, you can make your life a bit better again. And again. And you may not ever be able to get rid of your depression, but you can still have happiness in moments, and satisfaction in knowing you’re still alive and kicking. Kicking real hard.
