	<p>Hi! I'm a real jackass of all trades based out of Vancouver, where I attend
		the University of British Columbia studying English and living out of my van.
		I am a drummer currently looking for a steady band, having played for
		Gentle Mind for a year. I'm creating this entire website from scratch;
		it's been really fun to learn everything I need to create what I want.
		Don't hesitate to <a href="http://www.renaissanceboatman.com"> contact</a> me
		for any reason!</p>
